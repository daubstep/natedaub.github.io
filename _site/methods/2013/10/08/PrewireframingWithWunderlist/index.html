<h2>Prewireframing with Wunderlist</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>The interaction design industry is at it&#39;s prime.</p>

<p>Most people start with wireframing (laying out content with sketches or app like balsamiq.) It&#39;s important to break apart the content and beautification process, helping the designer and the client focus on smaller pieces of the puzzle, instead of everything at once. </p>

<p>But beginning with wireframing can cause problems. Users only read <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/">20% of content on a page</a>, so while wireframing may help with organizing content — it doesn&#39;t help with assuring the most visible content is actually important. </p>

<p>This is why I begin my design process one step earlier – sorting all the information on a page by importance. For that, I use Wunderlist.</p>

<p>Wunderlist is a fantastic little app — made by the also fantastic 6wunderkinder, a Berlin-based startup making todo lists simple and portable. They have an <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/Preparing-for-a-New-Era-of-Design-Wunderlist-on-iOS-7">iOS7 version in the works</a> — which I&#39;m pretty excited about, but lets not get sidetracked.</p>

<p>I use this app for everything from task management, to shopping lists, to things I find and want to check out later — so it was a natural choice for organizing web content.</p>

<p>Start by creating a new list. Add all the bits and pieces of information and sort! Start by grouping related content — an announcement heading, announcement deck and a call to action, for example, should be grouped. Create a new task titled &quot;Announcement&quot; and add all three elements as subtasks.</p>

<p>During this process, it&#39;s important not to think about what graphic will be used to display various types of information. For example, use &quot;announcement&quot; instead of &quot;banner&quot;, and &quot;call to action&quot; instead of button. This is extremely important in designing effective content. Example — when you are envisioning something as a banner, it will naturally have more emphasis than some text below, which could actually be of more importance. You can decide how elements are displayed when wireframing.</p>

<p>When all the elements have been sorted, order everything by importance. Then go into the tasks and sort their subtasks the same way — by importance. </p>

<p>Once this is done, you&#39;re ready to wireframe. When designing your wireframe, the top 20% of items on your list should be impossible to miss. Resize the list or open it on your phone/tablet so it&#39;s visible while wireframing and get to work!</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>
Keep your lists open until you are ready to launch. It&#39;s a great way to keep track of elements on a page. You can easily sync the lists between coworkers and comment on status updates, styles and potential problems.</p>
