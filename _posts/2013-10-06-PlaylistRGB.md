Music is an important part of my creative process. It triggers ideas and imagery I use in my work. I've decided to share a weekly playlist of great tunes that are hopefully as inspiring to you as they are to me! Each playlist will vary from electronic to folk, so check back often.

Below is my first playlist *In the Zone Out*. Its a mix with relaxing dream synths and some great beats. Enjoy!
