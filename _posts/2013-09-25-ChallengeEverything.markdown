Some people say I'm argumentative. I admit it I am. Maybe it's in my genes, maybe it's how I've been raised, maybe it's what makes me a designer. One thing I will say is that I challenge everything and you should, too.

To solve a problem, there is always a solution, but is there a better solution? Ask this. Every time. Find someone who will argue with you, who will challenge you and everything you say. 

Take the risk, try something new. If it doesn't work, try something else. Try something until you've tried everything. You may end up using your original idea, you may not, but in the end, you know it will be the best you can make it to be.

Whether it's nudging something a few pixels to the left or right, or a different shade of green. Challenge it until you can't challenge it anymore.

There are a few exceptions when you can't — and shouldn't — challenge everything. Especially when something is due 3 hours ago. Then you should just crank something out. I use a method I call the improve approach, but I'll post about that later.
